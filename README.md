# TOML parser for Scala [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jvican/stoml.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jvican/stoml)
We, computer scientists, need to get in touch with the world (oh, damn it). Yeah, that
means that the people we build software for need to interact with it in an easy way.
It's part of the job, we cannot ignore it. That's why I have built this library.
  
[TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#user-content-comment) aims to be a 
minimal configuration file format (minimal, yay!). Just what everyone is looking for. 
So this is a Scala library that allows you to parse any TOML file in a blink 
of an eye. It is very handy when the user is not a technical user. Also, it is easier
than YAML.

Built on top of [Fastparse](https://github.com/lihaoyi/fastparse) (which means astonishing speed for parsing) and [Scalacheck](https://github.com/rickynils/scalacheck) to automatically parse any combination of valid TOML files.
