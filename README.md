# TOML parser for Scala
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jvican/stoml.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jvican/stoml)
We, computer scientists, need to get in touch with the world (oh, damn it). That
means that the people we build software for need to interact with our software
in an easy way.
  
[TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#user-content-comment) aims to be a 
minimal configuration file format (yay!). Just what everyone is looking for. 
So this is a Scala library that allows you to parse any TOML file in a blink 
of an eye.

__This library is currently on development, although most of the functionality is already there, some is missing, specially fancy things.__
